# 🛡️ MineSafeAI: Revolutionizing Mining Safety with AI-Powered Insights

Mining accidents have historically been a significant concern in India, demanding effective safety measures and thorough analysis to prevent future incidents. **MineSafeAI** addresses this critical need by leveraging **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Agentic AI** to digitize, analyze, and provide **real-time insights** from extensive collections of Indian mining accident records.

Our platform transforms how safety data is processed and utilized — moving beyond traditional manual reporting to deliver intelligent, proactive accident prevention and regulatory compliance. By analyzing **143+ incident records** from **DGMS India (2015–2025)**, MineSafeAI aims to enhance safety, reduce manual auditing effort, and uncover deep insights into accident patterns and root causes.

## 🌟 Features

MineSafeAI combines real-time data analysis, AI-powered insights, and collaborative features to make mining operations safer and more efficient.

### 🧠 Core AI & Data Processing

* **Intelligent PDF Data Extraction:**
  Uses OCR to read text from DGMS PDF reports and **BERT-based NER** models to extract critical accident details.

* **Structured JSON Schema Conversion:**
  Converts extracted data into a standardized, queryable format:

  ```json
  {
    "mine": "Name of the Mine",
    "owner": "Owner of the Mine",
    "district": "District of the Mine",
    "state": "State (location) of the Mine",
    "mineral": "Mineral of the Mine",
    "place": "Place of Accident",
    "date": "Date of Accident",
    "time": "Time of Accident",
    "casualties": "Number of People killed",
    "injured": "Number of People seriously injured",
    "cause": "Prime facie cause of the Accident",
    "best_practices": "Best Practices only if explicitly mentioned",
    "cause_label": "Classified as one of 'Fire', 'Explosion', 'Roof Fall', 'Fall', 'Machinery', 'Transport', 'Electricity', 'Ground Movement', 'Eruption Of Water', 'Flying Pieces', 'Combustible Gas', 'Inundation'"
  }
  ```

* **Autonomous Safety Monitoring Agents:**

  * **Watch Agent:** Monitors DGMS alert websites for new updates.
  * **Fetch Agent:** Processes new PDF alerts and converts them to structured data.
  * **Database Update Agent:** Integrates processed data into Supabase in real time.
  * **Proactive Alert Engine:** Flags potential hazards (e.g., “Increase in transport machinery accidents in Jharkhand mines – Q3 2022”).
  * **Recommendation Engine:** Suggests preventive measures and inspection schedules.

* **Interactive “Digital Mine Safety Officer”:**
  A conversational AI interface that allows users to:

  * Query domain-specific information (e.g., “Show methane-related accidents in 2021 underground coal mines.”)
  * Receive compliance suggestions (e.g., “Mine X exceeds threshold for ground movement incidents; schedule slope stability inspection.”)

### 🖥️ Platform & UI Features

* **Real-time Monitoring Dashboard:** Interactive visual summary of accident trends and timelines.
* **Interactive Map Visualization:** Uses React Leaflet for spatial analysis of incidents.
* **AI-Powered Chat Interface:** Conversational insights from the “Digital Mine Safety Officer.”
* **Automated Safety Reports:** Generates detailed audit reports with zero manual effort.
* **Trend Analysis:** Identifies emerging risks using time-series and spatial patterns.
* **Admin Controls:** Manage user roles, permissions, and platform configurations.
